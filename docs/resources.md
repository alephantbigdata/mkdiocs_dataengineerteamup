It has sometimes been said that the data engineers involved in the Alephant Data Engineer Team Up don't have easy access to GPU systems to test and demonstrate machine learning, neural networks and large language model systems. 

Obviously one can rent these off a cloud provider but that can be expensive for an individual doing training. 

Alex McLintock is making available a development cluster of three machines, plus NAS storage. One of these machines has a decent GPU in it which works with CUDA for fast computation. Please [contact Alex](contact.md) if you want to make use of this.
