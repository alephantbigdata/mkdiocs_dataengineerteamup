# Peer to Peer Talks

We are organising some "peer-to-peer" talks about Data Engineering. The basic premise is that it is about tools and techniques that you might use in production. 

If you are interested in giving a talk, or want to see a particular subject then [get in touch](contact.md). Please try to avoid doing a Sales Pitch.

Please follow [http://alephant.eventbrite.com](http://alephant.eventbrite.com) to be informed when new talks are planned.


## Individual Presentations

These talks should be less about polished powerpoint slides and more about "Here is my experience that I am sharing". Some screenshots are fine instead of a demo. 

We should aim for approximately 20-30 minutes of presentation with 20-30 minutes of questions.

## Workshops / Panels

If we want to have two or three people discussing a topic then we may skip the presentation. In this case it is best to have the questions come up organically throughout the discussion. 

## Enabling Tech

We will probably be using Zoom and record the sessions. We will use eventbrite to let people subscribe to the event - with the proviso that it is difficult to properly share Zoom meeting info with eventbrite. Events will also be listed on the Slack Workspace. 

## Schedule

We will aim for one per month to allow for publicity and getting new people to attend.
