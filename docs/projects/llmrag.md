# LLM RAG

Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a commodity tool nowadays for chat bots and other uses but they do have problems.
One of the worst is the problem of hallucination - making up facts which look good.
The other problem is that they are typically run by third parties and you may not want to pass your data onto others for use with an LLM.

RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation can help with both these tasks.

This project is aimed at demontrating how data engineers can feed data for educating an LLM so that a chatbot app (for example) can be limited to a company's private data.
