# AWS Athena

When someone asks for a cloud based data warehouse they might be thinking of various servers sitting in the cloud running database software all the time. The alternative is to store your data in a cloud provided data lake (such as Amazon AWS S3) and to use a serverless SQL engine (such as Amazon AWS Athena). This project will demonstrate such a system.
