# Portfolio Projects

We are planning several projects to demonstrate our skills. This is because most of the time a data engineer is working on confidential material which cannot be included in a professional portfolio. At time of writing we have three skeleton portfolio projects. 

## AWS Athena

When someone asks for a cloud based data warehouse they might be thinking of various servers sitting in the cloud running database software all the time. The alternative is to store your data in a cloud provided data lake (such as Amazon AWS S3) and to use a serverless SQL engine (such as Amazon AWS Athena). This project will demonstrate such a system. 

## SQL

SQL is one of the Data Engineers most useful skills. This project is aimed at demonstrating those skills.

## LLM RAG

Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a commodity tool nowadays for chat bots and other uses but they do have problems.
One of the worst is the problem of hallucination - making up facts which look good.
The other problem is that they are typically run by third parties and you may not want to pass your data onto others for use with an LLM.

RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation can help with both these tasks.

This project is aimed at demontrating how data engineers can feed data for educating an LLM so that a chatbot app (for example) can be limited to a company's private data.
